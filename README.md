Analyze Airbnb data using MongoDB Atlas, perform data cleaning and preparation, develop interactive geospatial visualizations, and create dynamic plots to gain insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends

## Prerequisites
- `Python` programming language
- `plotly` library
- `mongo atlas`
- `streamlit` library

  install the required libraries using pip:
   ```
   pip install streamlit_option_menu
   pip install plotly
   pip install streamlit
   pip install pandas

  ```
   streamlit run your_filename.py 
   ```

## Work Flow
- Retrive Airbnb Data from MongoDb Atlas
